# Portfolio Project

This repository can host a static HTML portfolio site. Follow the steps below to publish it with GitHub Pages.

## 1. Add your HTML content
1. Create an `index.html` file (or update an existing one) in the repository root. This will be the entry point for your site.
2. Commit the file:
   ```bash
   git add index.html
   git commit -m "Add portfolio page"
   ```

## 2. Push the code to GitHub
Push your changes to the default branch (usually `main`):
```bash
git push origin main
```

## 3. Preview the site locally (optional)
Before publishing, you can check the page in a browser with any static file server:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` and open `index.html` to verify everything looks the way you expect. Stop the server with `Ctrl+C` when you are done.

## 4. Enable GitHub Pages
1. In your GitHub repository, go to **Settings â†’ Pages**.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch".
3. Choose the branch (`main`) and select `/ (root)` as the folder, then click **Save**.

GitHub will build and deploy the site. After a few minutes, a banner at the top of the Pages settings will display the URL where your HTML page is hosted. Share that link to allow others to view your portfolio.

## 5. Keep iterating on the site
Whenever you update your HTML (or supporting CSS/JS assets), commit and push the changes. GitHub Pages will automatically redeploy and refresh the live site. Remember to update links (like the email CTA) with your own details so visitors can reach you.
